# Spacebar

Spacebar is a telepathy-qt based SMS application that primarily targets Plasma Mobile.
It depends on Qt, a few KDE Frameworks (Kirigami2, KI18n, KPeople and KContacts) and telepathy-qt.

For development, you need `telepathy-ofono` or `telepathy-ring`, telepathy-qt and [a running ofono-phonesim](https://docs.plasma-mobile.org/Ofono.html).
